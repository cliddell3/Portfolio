As the first in my family to attend college, I was unsure of which major to choose. I just knew that I needed to pay for my own school and that I wanted an in-demand job upon graduation. I chose Mining Engineering. It is a very rare major. Only 12 universities in the US offer the program; each program graduates about ten students per year. As such, there are many scholarships available to those who choose this major. In May of 2019, I graduated debt-free with a job and an award for having the highest GPA among all seniors in my graduating class. Mission accomplished. 

I enjoyed my time as a Mining Engineer. In 2021, however, there were three fatalities at the mine I worked at. This caused me to rethink my career choices. I seized the opportunity to transfer internally and I became a Business Analyst. In the three years since, I have leveraged Excel, SQL, and Power BI to derive data-driven insights. 

Inspired by my background, I created a SQL database using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to study mining accidents. I obtained and cleaned the data in Excel. I executed SQL queries such as cast, average, count, sum, group by, and where. The visualizations from this data exploration were built using Tableau and can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/views/MiningData_16638036024550/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link .
